# Home Server configuration

Here lies some of the configuration I am using for running my home server.

Containerized in docker we have:
> Home Assistant (with Skyconnect USB Passthrough)
> PiHole to block ads and give local name resolution
> Nginx Proxy Manager to forward any configured hostname to the correct docker service/port.
