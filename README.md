# Home Server configuration

Here lies some of the configuration I am using for running my home server.

Containerized in docker we have:
- Home Assistant (with Skyconnect USB Passthrough)
- Mosquitto MQTT Server
- PiHole to block ads and give local name resolution
- QBittorrent for downloading files
- Jellyfin as a media server
- BabyBuddy to track baby metrics
- Cloudflare tunnel to "safely" expose to the internet
